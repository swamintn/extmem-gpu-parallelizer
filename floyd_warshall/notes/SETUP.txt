INSTALL LOCATION	    :	/opt/intel

BUILD			        :	https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-parallel-studio-xe-for-osx
				            REMEMBER TO SET THE ENVIRON VARIABLE BY RUNNING 
							"sh /opt/intel/bin/compilevars.sh <intel64>" (in the current console terminal)
							BETTER IS TO SET IT PERMANENTLY IN bash_profile itself

LACK OF SUPPORT FEATURES:	Lack of time feature, no gettime() / CLOCK_MONOTONIC 
							But this is not a fault of ICPC, MAC lacks the support for time

		
								STXXL

If cmake does not work, add /usr/local/lib, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

STEPS TO FACILITATE STXXL WITH CPU
	1)	Go to <project-directory>/build and do a cmake with -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc and -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc
	2)	Then include the cilk headers in stxxl-proj-folder/include	->	This step is not needed anymore
		Instead of the above, we can just add the /opt/intel/include folder in CMakefiles.txt in the <project-directory>
	3)	(Optional step)Then set PATH to the dyn lib of cilk by running source /opt/intel/bin/compilevars.sh <intel64>

INSTALLATION		:
http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-mac-os-x/#axzz4dFhwgiIv
IF nvcc does not work, add export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib,	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin	
IF CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version, it means your GPU can`t be 
manipulated by the CUDA runtime API, so you need to update your driver

export PATH=/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0.61/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0.61/lib${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
