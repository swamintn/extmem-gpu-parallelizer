#GPU on stampede

1) On login node, execute "module load cuda" to activate nvcc compiler
2) Even in job scripts, execute this command before running code

3) Stampede's K20 GPUs are compute capability 3.5 devices. When compiling your code, make sure to specify this level of capability with:
   nvcc -arch=compute_35 -code=sm_35 ...

# GPU Organization
1) General explanantion: myGPUFunc <<<BlockPerGrid, ThreadPerBlock>>>(int *d_ary, float *d_ary2);
2) The variables blockIdx and threadIdx contain the indexes for the invoked blocks and threads respectively. threadIdx is a three dimensional vector, and blockIdx is a two dimensional vector. Multi-dimensional indexes are simply for programmers' convenience. Grid and block size is defined by the variables, gridDim and blockDim.
