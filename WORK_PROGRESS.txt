										FLOYD-WARSHALL (All Pairs Shortest Path)

Check with Rathish about STXXL with Cilk
	DONE


Check if ablt to do memory-size setting for STXXL	
	Need to set the RAM size such that problem does not fit in it, and we do
	use external memory	
	Checked, we are able to set
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20475351/high-memory-usage-with-stxxl
	http://stxxl.org/tags/master/group__stlcont__vector.html	
	PageSize is number of blocks per page(4), CachePages is number of pages(8), 
	Block Size(2 MB), Page Replacement (LRU)

Check STXXL IO				
	Normal IO
	Buffered IO (vector_buf.cpp)
	Streamed IO to prefetch blocks
	Streamed input and materialize output is faster than Streamed input and buffered output	
	which is faster than iterator i/o (as no prefetching)


Layout the input in Z-morton format				:	    Refer to Professor's Advanced Programming lecture 


FLOYD-WARSHALL CPU Implementation with STXXL	:	    No parallelization at
														this level, only unicore CPU processing


Study standard CUDA documentation / tutorials	:	    Professor's supercomputing lectures, or 
														other better material


Write GPU code for transfer from CPU to GPU 
global memory and from GPU global to shared mem :	    Need to find GPU memory size, using some API


Parallel iterative code in GPU shared memory
using GPU kernel								:	    Need to figure this out


EVALUATION										:	    Compare GPU vs CPU performance, need to implement both
